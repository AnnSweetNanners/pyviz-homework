The real estate investment division has requested a dashboard for clients to illustrate a broad range of portfolio investment options in the Bay Area. This is a prototype dashboard to provide graphs, charts, and maps to investors to aid in the decision process.

### Rental Analysis

The rental analysis dashboard contains all data files, manipulated into a variety of dataframes and contains the code used to test the graphs, charts, and maps to ensure the data reads correctly.

### Dashboard
The code was then copied to create an interactive Panel dashboard to be used by the end client.
